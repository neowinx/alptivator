# alptivator

Docker image with activator installed over the [java:alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/java/) version of the official java image.

Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.

## Requirements

- Docker 1.6+

## About

This image is ready to use and prepared to execute all commands inside the yolomer user in the image. All npm packages are installed inside the /home/yolomer/.npm-packages directory.

### Enjoy
